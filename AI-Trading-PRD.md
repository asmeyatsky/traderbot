## 12. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### 12.1 Product Decisions
1. **Pricing Model:** What should we charge?
   - Options: Freemium (free tier + premium), flat monthly fee ($29-99), performance fee (20% of profits), AUM-based (0.5-1.5% annually)
   - **Recommendation:** Freemium (free paper trading) + $49/month for live trading, or 1% AUM annually, whichever is higher

2. **Advisory vs. Non-Advisory:**
   - Should we register as RIA (Registered Investment Advisor) or position as "tools/platform"?
   - **Trade-off:** RIA gives credibility but adds regulatory burden and fiduciary liability
   - **Recommendation:** Start as non-advisory, register as RIA in Phase 3 if user demand

3. **Human-in-the-Loop vs. Fully Autonomous:**
   - Should all trades require user approval, or fully autonomous by default?
   - **Recommendation:** Offer both modes: "Autopilot" (fully autonomous) and "Co-Pilot" (approval required)

### 12.2 Technical Decisions
4. **Cloud Provider:** AWS vs. Azure vs. Multi-Cloud?
   - **Recommendation:** AWS primary (mature ecosystem, strong ML tools), Azure secondary for hybrid cloud and Microsoft integrations

5. **ML Framework:** TensorFlow vs. PyTorch?
   - **Recommendation:** PyTorch (research/experimentation), TensorFlow Serving (production deployment)

6. **Database:** Which time-series database for market data?
   - Options: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, AWS Timestream, QuestDB
   - **Recommendation:** TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL-based, SQL-compatible, cost-effective)

7. **Broker Priority:** Which brokers to integrate first?
   - **Recommendation:** Alpaca (easy API, commission-free) + Interactive Brokers (institutional-grade, global reach)

### 12.3 Business Decisions
8. **Initial Markets:** US only, or international from day 1?
   - **Recommendation:** US equities only for MVP, expand to UK/EU in Phase 3 (regulatory complexity)

9. **Marketing Strategy:** How to acquire first 10,000 users?
   - Options: Paid ads (Google, Facebook), content marketing, influencer partnerships, referral program
   - **Recommendation:** Content marketing (blog, YouTube) + referral program ($50 bonus)

10. **Fundraising:** Bootstrap vs. raise capital?
    - MVP cost: $500K-1M (team, infrastructure, data)
    - **Recommendation:** Raise $2-3M seed round to accelerate development and marketing
